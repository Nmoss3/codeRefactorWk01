# Horiseon: Social Solution Solutions (Code Refactor)

Refactoring provided code in order to balance the pages styles and functionality.

## Description

The original code was provided to help me understand and produce a structured website using week one knowledge of HTML, CSS and Git.

While observing the original code I notice that the structure needed to be updated. Each section was given the div element instead of classifying it as a section, article or even footer.

Each image was not given an alt element which makes it difficult to know what the image is for users who may have visual impairments and if the page does not load properly the user will not even know something exists near the text.

A lot of the styles wanted to mesh together and make the page look confined. While classifying sections as the parent of a style it now takes priority and the page becomes easier to read.
