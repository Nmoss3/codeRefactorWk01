# codeRefactorWk01

Refactoring provided code in order to balance the pages styles and functionality.

## Description

Individuals who were attempting to use the previous version of the website were noticing that things were a little jumbled together and the page was not easy to use. In this project I was expected to make the page as user friendly as possible and have it fully functional.
